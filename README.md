# aberrant-framework

> Simple website framework in HTML and Sass, based on the Aberrant Media Framework

[Aberrant Media Framework](https://github.com/aberrantmedia/framework)

## Install

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/AirportWorld/aberrant-framework.git /path/to/directory
```

### Dependencies

- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to compile the site, and of course, [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)

#### Suggestions

- [npm](https://npmjs.com/). Yes, we know our `package.json` is just a placeholder, but we're working on it.

## Usage

To start a Jekyll server:

```sh
$ npm run start # or `jekyll serve`, if so you prefer
```

To simply build the site without starting one:

```sh
$ npm run build # or `jekyll build`, if so you prefer
```
